# HTML Resume
A lightweight, semantic, and professionally structured personal resume built entirely with HTML5. 
This project serves as a digital version of my professional profile, highlighting skills in Frontend Development, UI/UX Design, and Graphic Design.

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to create a clean, accessible, and fast-loading resume without the overhead of heavy frameworks, ensuring that the content remains the primary focus for recruiters and automated tracking systems (ATS).

## Project Structure
The code follows a standard HTML5 document flow:

1. Metadata: Defined in the `<head>` for character encoding and mobile responsiveness.

2. Header Section: Introduction with name and professional titles.

3. Body Sections: Detailed breakdowns of professional experience, technical skills, and educational background using semantic tags.

## HTML Tags Used
Here is a breakdown of every HTML element implemented in this `index.html` file:
